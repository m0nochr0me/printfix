  document_type: {{ file_type }}

  structural_findings: |
    {{ structural_findings | indent(4) }}
guidelines:
  - If both visual and structural analysis found the same issue, keep ONE entry with the higher confidence and source="merged"
  - Issues are duplicates if they share the same page AND issue type AND describe the same underlying problem
  - Assign final severity based on practical print impact
  - Order issues by severity (critical first), then by page number
