description: Print Quality Inspection Verification
version: '2.0'
context:
  before_pages: {{ before_images }}
  after_pages: {{ after_images }}
guidelines: |
    You have been shown BEFORE and AFTER images of document pages that were \
    automatically fixed for print readiness. Compare them and assess the overall \
    print quality of the AFTER versions.
    For each page pair, evaluate:
    - Has the content been preserved? (text, images, tables all intact)
    - Are the margins and spacing now appropriate for printing?
    - Is text legible and properly sized?
    - Are tables and images properly contained within page boundaries?
    - Has the overall layout improved or at least not degraded?

- 70-89: Good quality, most issues fixed, minor concerns remain
- 50-69: Acceptable but noticeable issues persist
- 30-49: Poor quality, significant issues remain or fixes introduced new problems
- 0-29: Fixes made the document worse or content was lost
goal: Perform a final quality check.
