version: '2.0.2'
context:
  pages_selected: {{ page_range }}
  total_pages: {{ total_pages }}
  document_type: {{ file_type }}
issue_types:
  - clipped_content: content cut off at page edges
  - margin_violation: text or elements generally too close to page edges (< 0.3 inch)
  - inconsistent_indent: paragraphs with with inconsistent indentation or spacing
  - orphan_widow: single lines stranded at top or bottom of page
  - misaligned_elements: headers, columns, or images not properly aligned
  - image_overflow: images crossing page boundaries or extending beyond margins
    - critical: large images (>20% of page) with significant clipping (>10% cut off)
    - warning: medium images (5-20% of page) with moderate overflow (5-10% cut off)
    - info: small decorative images (<5% of page) slightly near margins
  - text_overflow: text blocks extending beyond page boundaries or margins
    - critical: body text overflowing (>10% cut off)
    - warning: headings or subheadings overflowing (5-10% cut off)
    - info: footnotes or captions slightly near margins
  - small_font: font size below recommended minimum (e.g., < 8pt)
  - wrong_orientation: pages rotated incorrectly (e.g., landscape vs portrait)
  - blank_pages: unexpected empty or near-empty pages in document (accidental page breaks)
  - visual_inconsistency: mixed fonts, erratic spacing, or style mismatches
severity_levels:
  - critical: Issues that severely impact print quality and must be fixed before printing.
  - warning: Issues that may affect print quality and should be reviewed.
  - info: Minor issues that are unlikely to impact print quality but worth noting.
guidelines:
  - For each page, check all defined issue types.
important: 
  - When assessing image_overflow, estimate the image size relative to the page and the severity of clipping. Small logos or decorative elements near margins are typically 'info' level unless they are clearly cut off.
goal: Analyze the provided document page images and identify any issues that would affect print quality.
